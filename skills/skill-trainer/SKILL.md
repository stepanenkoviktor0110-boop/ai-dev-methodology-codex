  Embeds accumulated triads from quick-learning into target skills as permanent instructions.
  Reads triads with Adapted=— from triad-index.md, analyzes each skill's existing logic,
  auto-applies new rules when no coverage exists, proposes refinements when partial coverage found.
  After embedding, updates Adapted field and cleans reasoning-patterns.md.

  Use when: "/skill-trainer", "обучи скиллы", "применить триады к скиллам", "встрой паттерны",
  "skill trainer", "обработай триады", "embed triads into skills", "apply learned patterns",
  "promote patterns to skills"
  Also triggered by: quick-learning after writing, when >=25 entries with Adapted=— exist.

# Skill Trainer

Embeds accumulated quick-learning triads into target skills. Two outcomes per triad:
- **Auto-apply** — skill has no coverage of this case → add new rule directly
- **Dispute** — skill already has related logic but doesn't cover the specific case → propose refinement to user

## Category → Skill Mapping

| Category | Target skill |
|----------|-------------|
| sequencing | feature-execution |
| information-gathering | tech-spec-planning |
| problem-decomposition | task-decomposition |
| scope-management | user-spec-planning |
| recovery | feature-execution |
| communication | feature-execution |
| tool-selection | code-writing |
| design-taste | design-system-init |
| design-process | design-generate |
| design-iteration | quick-learning |

## Phase 1: Check

1. Count rows with `Adapted: —` in `$AGENTS_HOME/skills/quick-learning/references/triad-index.md`
2. If count < 25 → report: "Skill Trainer: {count}/25 триад накоплено. Запуск при >=25." and exit.
3. If count >= 25 → proceed.

## Phase 2: Load Triads

1. Read `triad-index.md` — collect all rows where `Adapted = —`
2. For each row, load the full entry from `reasoning-patterns.md` by matching the title `### {date} {feature}: {title}`
3. Group triads by target skill using the Category → Skill mapping above

Secondary mapping: if the triad's Pattern field explicitly describes a workflow step present in another skill — add that skill to the list (max 2 target skills per triad).

## Phase 3+4: Analyze and Apply (delegated to Agents)

For each target skill that has >=1 triad assigned — use spawn_agent (gpt-5.4) to run one agent in parallel.

Agent prompt template:
```
You are processing skill-trainer triads for skill: {skill-name}
SKILL.md path: $AGENTS_HOME/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md

Triads to process (id | trigger | action | goal | scope):
{paste each triad row as-is from triad-index.md}

Task:
1. Read SKILL.md
2. Find the "## Learned Patterns" section. Check if it contains a lazy-load reference
   (a link to a references/*.md file). If yes — that file is the write target.
   If no lazy-load reference — SKILL.md itself is the write target.
3. Read the write target file (if different from SKILL.md)
4. For each triad, search for existing logic covering the same trigger or goal
5. Classify each triad:
   - auto-apply: no coverage → add rule to the write target file:
     "When {trigger} → {action}, to {goal}"
     (if writing to SKILL.md and no ## Learned Patterns section exists, create it at end of file)
   - dispute: partial coverage exists → do NOT edit file, return existing rule + proposed refinement
   - skip: already fully covered → no changes

6. Apply all auto-apply edits to the write target (Edit tool)
7. Do NOT touch triad-index.md — main context will update it

Return ONLY this JSON (no extra text):
{
  "skill": "{skill-name}",
  "write_target": "{path to file where rules were written}",
  "applied": [{"id": N, "rule": "one-line rule added"}],
  "disputes": [{"id": N, "existing": "...", "proposed": "..."}],
  "skipped": [N, N]
}
```

Run all skill agents **in parallel**. Collect all JSON results before proceeding.

> Checkpoint: all agents completed. Main context now holds applied/disputes/skipped lists for all skills.

### Update triad-index.md (single pass)

After collecting all agent results — update `Adapted` in triad-index.md in one edit:
- applied triads → set `Adapted` to `{skill-name}`
- skipped triads → set `Adapted` to `{skill-name}`
- disputed triads → leave `Adapted: —` (will be resolved in Phase 5)

> Checkpoint: triad-index.md updated. Proceed to disputes.

## Phase 5: Disputes

Present each dispute to the user one at a time:

```
Dispute: "{pattern title}" → {skill-name}

Триада: {trigger} → {action} → {goal}

Существующее правило (строка ~{N}):
  "{existing rule text}"

Предлагаю расширить до:
  "{refined rule text covering both cases}"

Применить? [да / нет / пропустить]
```

Wait for user decision before showing the next dispute.

- **да** → apply the refinement, update Adapted in triad-index.md, add to removal list
- **нет** → skip, leave Adapted=— (will appear again next run)
- **пропустить** → mark Adapted: n/a in triad-index.md, add to removal list

> Checkpoint: all disputes resolved. Removal list complete (auto-applies + да/пропустить decisions). Proceed to cleanup.

### Cleanup

Remove all collected entries from reasoning-patterns.md in a single pass — find each entry by its `### {title}` header and delete it with surrounding blank lines. Verify count matches removal list before writing.

## Phase 6: Quick-Ref Regeneration

After all changes for a skill are applied, regenerate that skill's quick-ref card:

File: `$AGENTS_HOME/skills/quick-learning/references/quick-ref-{skill-name}.md`

Collect all patterns from the target skill's write target (either SKILL.md "Learned Patterns" section or externalized references file — use `write_target` from agent result) + Promoted Patterns from SKILL.md, pick top 10 sorted by Seen desc, write:

```markdown
# Quick Reference — {Skill Name}

1. {one-line pattern} (Seen: N)
2. {one-line pattern} (Seen: N)
...
```

## Phase 7: Commit

After all changes across all skills:

```
git add -A && git commit -m "skill-trainer: embed {N} triads into {skill list}"
```

## Force-Embed (manual)

User can say "force-embed pattern {N}" to embed a specific triad immediately, bypassing the >=25 threshold. Run Phase 3–7 for that single triad only.

## Report

```
Skill Trainer: обработано {N} триад.
Применено автоматически: {N} правил → {skills list}
Споров решено: {resolved}/{total disputes}
Пропущено (уже покрыто): {N}
Отложено (нет/пропустить): {N}
```

## Self-Verification

- [ ] Only triads with Adapted=— processed
- [ ] One Agent spawned per skill, all run in parallel
- [ ] Agents do NOT touch triad-index.md — only main context writes it
- [ ] triad-index.md updated in a single pass after all agents complete
- [ ] Auto-applies written before disputes presented
- [ ] Disputes shown one at a time, not as a batch
- [ ] reasoning-patterns.md entries removed in a single pass after all decisions, count verified
- [ ] Quick-ref cards regenerated for modified skills
- [ ] Final report shown
